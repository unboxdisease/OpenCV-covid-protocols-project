### Face-Mask Detection with Counting  

Detecting the person was done by OpenCVâ€™s open source pre trained models like the
mobilenet SSD. The mobilenet-ssd model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD) network
intended to perform object detection. This model is implemented using the Caffe
framework. This model detects objects in the video feed and classifies them into 1 out of 80
classes. We move forward once a person is detected. This solves the first part of our
problem.
To assign the person a unique ID we need to track its bounding box across all frames. This
was performed by the Euclidean distance tracker which keeps track of small movements in
the bounding box and assigns a unique ID to all the bounding boxes.
For mask detection we first detect face by a pretrained faceNet model, and then apply
maskNet (Chandrika Deb Face-Mask-Detection
https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection) model to it. This part has decent
accuracy and could be a subject of future improvement.
The distance has been approximated using bounding boxes and their sizes (assuming size
of the face remains the same for everyone hence same size bounding boxes are formed at
equal distance from the camera). Depth is calculated by the size of the bounding box. To
detect the distance of people from the camera, triangle similarity technique was used.
Let us assume that a person is at a distance D (in centimetres) from the camera and the
person's actual height is H (I have assumed that the average height of humans in 165
centimetres). Using the object detection code above, we can identify the pixel height P
of the person using the bounding box coordinates. Using these values, the focal length
of the camera can be calculated using the below formula
`F = (P x D) / H`
Then we can use this :
`D' = (H x F) / P`
For depth estimation. Now that we know the depth of the person from the camera, we can
move on to calculate the distance between two people in a video. There can be a number
of people detected in a video. So the Euclidean distance is calculated between the midpoint
of the bounding boxes of all the people detected.
